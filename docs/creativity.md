Generative AI extends creativity and improves productivity. Translating these broad benefits into practical opportunities remains opaque and overwhelming.

## Equations

I propose a simple pidgin to describe generative AI use cases in a consistent format.

!!! example "Use Case Equation"

    Use Case = Mode + Action + Container

    - Mode : set of multimodal input and outputs
    - Action : set of verbs
    - Container : set of features

Some examples of how to frame use cases using this equation:

- Marketing + Text + Summarise + Press Release ->

I find the following three questions useful to map this opportunity space:

- How might product managers describe Generative AI use cases?
- How might product managers use Generative AI to generate these use cases?
- Ho

Kiln tries to articulate this

it does this. Kiln takes these broad benefits and refines its application for product managers in three ways :

- a product equation to label AI use cases
- a theory of single player experience
- tools
- time windows
- diffusion of innovation theory?

Kiln is a single player experience that removes as many humans-in-the-loop as possible to

## Decisions

Twin intent is a decision tool that helps define the map and identify the journey. Agent reasoning is a decision tool that helps plot and traverse the route.
