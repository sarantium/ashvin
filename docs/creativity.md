Generative AI extends creativity and improves productivity. Translating these broad benefits into practical opportunities remains opaque and overwhelming.

One way to systematically investigate the possibilities and boundaries of AI is to set forth a series of hypotheses which are testable around creativity and productivity. A second way to move forward on this is to have separate implementations for productivity and productivity.

My approach is to package creativity tests and outputs into a separate website : fictionideas.com

Productivity tests remains on this site and the Kiln App.

## Equations

I propose a simple pidgin to describe generative AI use cases in a consistent format.

!!! example "Use Case Equation"

    Use Case = Mode + Action + Container

    - Mode : set of multimodal input and outputs
    - Action : set of verbs
    - Container : set of features

Some examples of how to frame use cases using this equation:

- Marketing + Text + Summarise + Press Release ->

I find the following three questions useful to map this opportunity space:

- How might product managers describe Generative AI use cases?
- How might product managers use Generative AI to generate these use cases?
- Ho

Kiln tries to articulate this

it does this. Kiln takes these broad benefits and refines its application for product managers in three ways :

- a product equation to label AI use cases
- a theory of single player experience
- tools
- time windows
- diffusion of innovation theory?

Kiln is a single player experience that removes as many humans-in-the-loop as possible to

## Decisions

Twin intent is a decision tool that helps define the map and identify the journey. Agent reasoning is a decision tool that helps plot and traverse the route.
