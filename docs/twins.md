<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./assets/impostor.png"></p>

Positioning increases confidence in the stories that product managers tell themselves and others about the sequence and value of product activity.

Even expert product managers and engineers experience impostor syndrome. Positioning helps individuals and teams battle this uncertainty by:

- [x] locating current activity
- [x] tracing past routes
- [x] planning future routes

!!! tip

    **Positioning** helps create **convincing** and **connected** explanations about **product development practice**

## :material-robot-outline: Generating

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./assets/altman.png"></p>

Generating increases the diversity and velocity of drafting and improving artifacts at every stage and phase of the product development lifecycle.

Combining large language model computation and specialist product prompts in an accessible interface, it encourages exploration and iteration by:

- [x] explaining ideas
- [x] answering questions
- [x] creating and improving artifacts

!!! tip

    **Generating** helps create **more** and **more diverse** product artifacts **faster**
