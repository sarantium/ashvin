# On Writing

Writing is thinking made visible, and thinking changes, so the writing changes.

I return to everything here, stitching, snipping, reworking. Nothing is archive. If you read something last month and it reads differently now, that's not error.

I write with a golem now. It takes what I mean and what it offers and produces a third thing, neither mine nor not mine. This is how writing works now. The tool is part of the practice.

What's happened to writing is what happens to every practice when the underlying economics shift. The old package (solitary author, fixed text, finished product) has come apart. What's reassembling is something else: collaborative, iterative and alive. 

The golem and I have an arrangement. It keeps the work open and I keep asking what's mine.

You might have one as well because the reader changed when the writer did.
