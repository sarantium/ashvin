## State of AI Product 2024

## BIG IDEA

Take scoble's list of 4000 cmpanies and review them in a product way

## Various thoughts

- this page and possibly a report with multiple sub pages will capture my synthesis of the state of ai in 2024
- could become a yearly thing. Is a living document. Takes stuff from blog, reading list etc.
- to be published as an academic article somewhere, maybe in arxiv first?
- maybe usable at work to teach others about AI more conceptually?

## Utopia and dystopia

It is easy to say human-in-the-loop. Is that more of a marketing exercise? Ultimately, centaurs (https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/17/reverse-centaur/#reverse-centaur) and reverse centaurs (https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/19/bubblenomics/) may be more likely according to Cory doctorow? As we are fumbling our way into this future what happens?
