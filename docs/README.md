Digital twins are software representations of things. These things can be an object, person, process or system. For example, cars, influencers, transactions, or supply chains can all have digital twins.

Less commonly understood is that digital twins can also exist for purely digital things - NPCs, codebases, bots - with no physical counterpart. Like lego or fractals, digital twins can also have infinite complexity. For example, fleet twins can be composed of car twins which are composed of parts twins, which are all interconnected in a complex automotive ecosystem of insurer twins and mechanic twins.

At its core a digital twin is both a record of a thing's past and a guide to its future. More than a static ledger, the promise of a twin that makes it different from a copy or a clone is that it has intent and evolves.

!!! tip

    **Digital twins** have **intent** and **evolve**

reduce or embrace uncertainty in order to speed up outcomes.

Grid is a shared language and generative app but it also **embraces the uncertainty and creativity**.....uncertainty is a feature not a bug. riffing off hallucinations are a feature..

- face two additional challenges : domain uncertainty and result uncertainty.

**_Domain Uncertainty_**

Uncertainty makes this harder, and most pro

With AI features and products, there is exponentially more domain uncertainty

increases individual certainty and improves group collaboration by providing a precise language for connecting essential product outputs.

**_Generating_** is an [app](https://gridpm.streamlit.app) that increases individual creativity and introduces unpredictability by providing a machine learning interface to explore and draft a wide variety of product artifacts.

## :material-key-alert-outline: Key Features

Grid's key features are:

- **Simple**: The entire product development process is displayed on a single page
- **Consistent**: Standardised vocabulary for describing different stages and activities
- **Intuitive**: Cell coordinates make navigation and referencing a breeze
- **Curated**: Modern product tools and templates selected with a bias for lean workflows
- **Extensible**: Add, remove or modify rows, columns and cells to get the right fit
- **Creative**: Generate better product artifacts in seconds

## :material-map-marker-plus-outline: Positioning

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./assets/impostor.png"></p>

Positioning increases confidence in the stories that product managers tell themselves and others about the sequence and value of product activity.

Even expert product managers and engineers experience impostor syndrome. Positioning helps individuals and teams battle this uncertainty by:

- [x] locating current activity
- [x] tracing past routes
- [x] planning future routes

!!! tip

    **Positioning** helps create **convincing** and **connected** explanations about **product development practice**

## :material-robot-outline: Generating

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./assets/altman.png"></p>

Generating increases the diversity and velocity of drafting and improving artifacts at every stage and phase of the product development lifecycle.

Combining large language model computation and specialist product prompts in an accessible interface, it encourages exploration and iteration by:

- [x] explaining ideas
- [x] answering questions
- [x] creating and improving artifacts

!!! tip

    **Generating** helps create **more** and **more diverse** product artifacts **faster**
