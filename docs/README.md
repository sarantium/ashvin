    <em><b>Digital Twins</b> for <b>Product Managers</b></em>
</p>

Digital twins are software representations of things. These things can be objects, people, processes or systems. For example, cars, influencers, manufacturing, and cities can all have digital twins.

Less commonly understood is that digital twins can also exist for purely digital things - NPCs, codebases, bots - with no physical counterpart.

Like lego or fractals, digital twins have depth and complexity. For example, fleet twins can be composed of car twins which are composed of parts twins, which are all interconnected in a complex automotive ecosystem of user (dealer, buyer) and process (sales, service, insurance) twins.

At its core a digital twin is both a record of a thing's past and a guide to its future. More than a static ledger, the promise of a twin that makes it different from a copy or clone is that it has intent and evolves.

!!! tip

    **Digital twins** have **intent** and **evolve**

![Agents](assets/clones_1.jpg)

Agents are autonomous, decision making entities. They focus on task objectives - planning, searching, organising, communicating - act based on decision models and have access to specific tools.

Agents work for twins. If a twin is a startup, an agent is a skilled contractor employed to get stuff done. Generative agents have far more freedom to choose what to work on and how to execute than traditional rules based bots.

!!! tip

    **Digital twins** are **startups** that employ **generative agents** as **contractors**

A fuzzy but useful analogy is to think of twins as startups that employ specialised agents as employees to get things done.

that digital twins can use to get things done. Think of agents as a sort of specialised employee with a limited lifespan.

The key difference between rules-based bots and agents, is that agents have autonomy

reduce or embrace uncertainty in order to speed up outcomes.

Grid is a shared language and generative app but it also **embraces the uncertainty and creativity**.....uncertainty is a feature not a bug. riffing off hallucinations are a feature..

- face two additional challenges : domain uncertainty and result uncertainty.

**_Domain Uncertainty_**

Uncertainty makes this harder, and most pro

With AI features and products, there is exponentially more domain uncertainty

increases individual certainty and improves group collaboration by providing a precise language for connecting essential product outputs.

**_Generating_** is an [app](https://gridpm.streamlit.app) that increases individual creativity and introduces unpredictability by providing a machine learning interface to explore and draft a wide variety of product artifacts.

## :material-key-alert-outline: Key Features

Grid's key features are:

- **Simple**: The entire product development process is displayed on a single page
- **Consistent**: Standardised vocabulary for describing different stages and activities
- **Intuitive**: Cell coordinates make navigation and referencing a breeze
- **Curated**: Modern product tools and templates selected with a bias for lean workflows
- **Extensible**: Add, remove or modify rows, columns and cells to get the right fit
- **Creative**: Generate better product artifacts in seconds

## :material-map-marker-plus-outline: Positioning

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./assets/impostor.png"></p>

Positioning increases confidence in the stories that product managers tell themselves and others about the sequence and value of product activity.

Even expert product managers and engineers experience impostor syndrome. Positioning helps individuals and teams battle this uncertainty by:

- [x] locating current activity
- [x] tracing past routes
- [x] planning future routes

!!! tip

    **Positioning** helps create **convincing** and **connected** explanations about **product development practice**

## :material-robot-outline: Generating

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./assets/altman.png"></p>

Generating increases the diversity and velocity of drafting and improving artifacts at every stage and phase of the product development lifecycle.

Combining large language model computation and specialist product prompts in an accessible interface, it encourages exploration and iteration by:

- [x] explaining ideas
- [x] answering questions
- [x] creating and improving artifacts

!!! tip

    **Generating** helps create **more** and **more diverse** product artifacts **faster**
