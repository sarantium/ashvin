A list of emerging books and papers about artificial intelligence that help make sense of how this technology can be applied effectively in business contexts.

Each entry has an abbreviated title, a link to the source document (where available) and a short description of its content. I'm interested in both abstract frameworks and concrete experiments.

- :light_bulb: concepts and frameworks
- :microscope: quantitative and qualitative primary data
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: market trends and secondary data
