What if we defined the possibility space for AI modules as a Cartesian product of capabilities, containers and modes? We'd end up with a list of tuples, each of which had a specific combination.

!!! example "Equation"

    *SETS*


    **modes** = {linguistic, visual, audio, gestural, spatial, tacticle, olfactory, gustatory, multimedia, kinesthetic, ...}

    capabilities = {...}

    containers = {...}

    *COMBINATIONS*

    Number_Of_Combinations = |modes| * |capabilities| * |containers|

Earlier posts identified three concepts: [capabilities, containers](2023-11-26.md) , and [multimodal literacies](2023-11-27.md).

What if we treated the idea of modular lego as a math-like problem for product specification? Something like this :

Mode + Capability + Container = Module
