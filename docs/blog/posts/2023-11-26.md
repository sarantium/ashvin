As we implement AI features into our products, we need a mental model that helps make sense of this domain. A shared language is a starting point for sense making.

**Capabilities** are core actions that generative AI can accomplish and are usually represented as verbs. Examples include: _summarise, create, retrieve, research, and interact_. Capabilities are a bit like _Jobs-To-Be-Done_ for AI.

**Containers** are parts of a user interface or architecture that extract, transform and load information. These include _search bars, notes, wizards, and databases_.

Capabilities are connected to containers in a many to many relationship. Thinking of AI features as **capability-container modules** that can be reused in different parts of an application, just like a design system does for user interfaces, helps drive business cases.
