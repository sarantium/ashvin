A list of resources I find really interesting and useful. Vaguely organised. The aim is for utility not precision. I clean and sort these occasionally.

## Ebooks

- [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/)

## SWYX Awesome AI

- [AI Podcasts and Newsletters](https://github.com/swyxio/ai-notes/blob/main/Resources/Good%20AI%20Podcasts%20and%20Newsletters.md)
