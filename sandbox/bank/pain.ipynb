Maria needs to be agile, making decisions that capitalize on trends while managing stock and customer satisfaction. She generates abundant data from sales, online interactions, and customer feedback, but it's compartmentalized, overwhelming, and not predictive. What's missing is a dynamic, comprehensive view that could not only make sense of the data but also simulate future scenarios. \n",

This would transform abstract numbers and trends into a visceral, hands-on experience. It would allow her to foresee outcomes, understand customer behaviors, and test potential business strategies in a risk-free environment. Through this, Maria could identify pitfalls before they happen, anticipate customer needs, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.\n",
