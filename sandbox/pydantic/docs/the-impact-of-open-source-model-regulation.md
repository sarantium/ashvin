#The Impact of Open Source Model Regulation

### Analyze the Potential Consequences of Regulating Open Source Models under SB 1047

Regulating open source AI models can have significant unintended consequences, stifling innovation and undermining safety.

- **Blocking Open Source Frontier Models**: Stringent regulations may prevent the release of state-of-the-art open source models, limiting their availability to large, commercial entities.

  Example: Under SB 1047, once a model hits the computation threshold, it can't be released openly.

- **Increase of Politicization and Reduced Safety**: Misguided legislation could shift AI development to less regulated jurisdictions, reducing oversight and safety.

  Example: Moving AI out of California to states with fewer restrictions, or to countries like China where the regulatory environment is different.

> **Callout:** “This general purpose computation capability is not inherently 'safe' or 'unsafe'… All of these can be, and often have been, used to cause harm.”
