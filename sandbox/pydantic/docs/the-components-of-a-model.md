#The Components of a Model

### Explain the Fundamental Components of AI Models and Their Functions

Understanding the components of AI models is crucial for policy makers to appreciate the implications of AI legislation.

- **Model Weights**: These are lists of numbers (parameters) resulting from the training process. They define how the model processes inputs to generate outputs. 
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
    A[Input Sequence] --> B((Model Weights))
    B --> C{Model Code}
    C --> D[Output Sequence]
  ```

  Example: Meta's Llama 3 70b model has weights like [0.0005, 0.0005, 0.0004, 0.0012, -0.0016, 0.0025, 0.0009, 0.0006, 0.0003, 0.0005].

- **Model Code**: The code consists of mathematical operations (mainly matrix multiplications) that use the weights to process inputs and produce outputs.

  Example: The source code for Llama 3 is about 300 lines, performing fundamental calculations.

- **Training Process**: Models are trained through iterative processes, adjusting weights to minimize errors in predicting outputs from inputs.

  Steps: 
  1. Initialize weights with random values.
  2. Process input sequences to generate outputs.
  3. Compare outputs to target results.
  4. Adjust weights accordingly.

- **Fine-Tuning**: Involves adjusting an existing model’s weights to improve performance on specific tasks. It demonstrates how flexible and powerful AI models can be quickly adapted.

> **Callout:** “The process of creating the weights is called training. By repeating this lots of times, the neural network gets closer and closer to calculating the target numbers.”
