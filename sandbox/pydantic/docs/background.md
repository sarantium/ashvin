### Contextual Information about SB 1047 and the Gap in Knowledge among Policy Makers

SB 1047 is a legislative bill in California aimed at introducing regulations to ensure AI models are safe before deployment. Many policy makers, however, lack a technical background in AI, making it difficult for them to foresee the real-world impacts of such regulations.

- **Lobbying for AI Safety Legislation**: Various well-funded groups lobby for “AI safety” legislation, pushing bills like SB 1047 through the legislative process.
- **SB 1047's Objectives**: The bill seeks to regulate the release and deployment of large AI models, ensuring they do not cause harm. 
- **Lack of AI Background Among Policy Makers**: Without a proper understanding of AI, policy makers struggle to craft effective regulations that meet their intended goals.

> **Callout:** “Few, if any, of the policy makers working on this kind of legislation have a background in AI, and therefore it’s hard for them to fully understand the real practical implications of the legislative language that’s being brought to them for consideration.”
