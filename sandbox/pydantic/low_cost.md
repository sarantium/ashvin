If I was going to start a company today, I would not aim for a $100M+ exit. VCs will hate this, but here's what I think the new startup model looks like:

BACKGROUND:

In 2024, what should the goal be of starting a new venture?

Simple.

Sell the company as soon as you're ensured that every person in the team makes an average of $600K - $1M / year in the 18m-24m month period.

Why?

Because early stage entrepreneurs take on far too much risk.

Ask yourself, would you rather have a lottery ticket for $100M, where most of the proceeds go to institutional investors or would you rather sell for ~$15M where you get to keep all the proceeds and set aside some for the next job?

If your answer is the latter, then let me show you how you start your next venture:

YOUR CONTRIBUTION?

- Don’t build anything novel. Stay away from technical innovation. Repackage what already exists for the lower end of the market
- All you need to do is disrupt the GTM and pricing plan (charge $99-$495/mo in a market that’s used to paying $20K+/year)
- Offer 50% of the most used features disrupting the existing vendors and then sell the company back to one of the existing vendors

HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY A BUSINESS IDEA?

If you want to impress VCs then you can go into a rabbit hole justifying competition and why you are different and create slides on how you use LLMs or AI. I can't help you with that, but if you want to bootstrap the business then here’s a framework to identify ideas:

1. Keep it simple: Stay away from anything complicated or new. New technologies come with a lot of risk, let VCs and well capitalized companies take that risk - not you.

2. High ACV Markets: Do a thorough research on G2 or Trustradius and find categories that have SaaS tools selling for anything above $15K in ACV. The higher the better.

3. Low Building Cost: Find a SaaS category where you can literally copy the tool from other competitors with minimal effort.

4. Customer List : Prefer category where it is easy to pull the customers of the tool using technographics providers (such as builtwith or HGInsights).

5. Choose a category where one of co founders have expertise in or have prior work experience as an exec and can command trust.

HOW DO YOU BUILD THE TECHNOLOGY?

- The entire technology needs to be developed by a single full stack developer in less than 6 weeks. Period.
- Don’t outsource. One of the co-founders needs to be able to build the entire tool. Avoid UI/UX or design cycles if possible.
- Buy free trials of existing tool in the market and make a cheap knockoff of the most popular used interfaces or workflows
- Use automation to generate code, add some of your own skin and viola you have a product that can be marketed
- Don’t invest in technology thereafter, other than minor enhancements

GO TO MARKET

- Use Product Led Growth and Linkedin Led Growth strategies
  Build trust with your target segment with thought leadership posts

- Make it available for self serve signup

- Do outbound email campaigns to existing customers of the tool

- Use signals and triggers to identify new opportunities

- Build a brand. You have a sub standard technology and tool but that should not be an excuse to not build a trustworthy and high quality brand

- As a team you need to talk to at least 100 potential customers every week non stop for a who year. These calls need to be 20 min each where you dont sell and only generate credibility and trust

CONTENT/SELF-SERVE CS:

- You don't want to end up hiring 20 CS or Support staff and be forced to raise money, so you need a good knowledge base and self serve content. That means investing in automation and bots

DISRUPTION:

- We are entering a phase in economy where good enough tools will be attractive if it costs much much lower.

- Aggressively sell PLG with a freemium model. Liberally offer discounts. Grab Marketshare.

- Your goal is to wreck the market for others not to maximize revenues.

PLAN FOR AN EXIT

- In the first six month of the venture, build relationship with other competitors

- Make sure they know you exist

- Try to articulate how your approach is different. They will likely not see your crippled solution and low end GTM as a threat

- In the next 12 months, Sign up 1000’s of their customers at throwaway prices and then go back to them offering your business

- Sale Price: Don’t get greedy, do your math. As long as you can ensure everybody makes a healthy per year earnings (say $500K - $1M/year) then sell the business. Depending upon the team size (hopefully small) and the time spent - this number can be $6M - $10M.

POST EXIT AND SUCCESSFULL INTEGRATION

- After a successful exit and break, set aside 20% of the wins for the next job.

- Take a month break. Meet every week to discuss a new business idea.

- Once decided. Set your clock. Build a new technology in the next 6 weeks and off you start on another race. Rinse. Repeat.
