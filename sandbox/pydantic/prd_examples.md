## Service Overview

A cloud-based Dispute Management as a Service (DMaaS) platform designed to be integrated into the existing digital frameworks of banks, credit unions, and fintechs. This platform will empower these institutions to offer advanced dispute management and resolution capabilities directly to their consumers, ensuring a seamless, transparent, and efficient experience.

## User Stories (Detailed)

### Consumer Perspective:

- As a consumer, I want to initiate a dispute through a mobile app, where I can easily select the transaction in question from my transaction history, specify the reason for the dispute from a predefined list (e.g., fraudulent transaction, service not received), and upload any supporting documents like receipts or correspondence directly from my phone.

### Vendor Perspective:

- As a vendor, I want to receive instant notifications of disputes through an online dashboard and email, where I can review the dispute details, submit evidence such as delivery proof or terms of service agreements, and communicate directly with the mediator (fintech/bank) within the platform to expedite resolution.

### Fintech/Bank Perspective:

- As a fintech/bank, I want to have an AI-assisted dashboard that automatically categorizes and prioritizes incoming disputes based on their complexity, the amount involved, and the urgency. The system should offer a preliminary analysis based on transaction history and user behavior to suggest if a dispute might be valid or could be resolved without escalation.

## User Experience (Deep Dive)

### Step 1: Dispute Initiation by Consumer

- Consumers log into their financial institution's app, navigate to their transaction history, and select the transaction in question.
- The app presents a simple form asking the consumer to select a dispute reason and prompts them to provide a brief description of the issue. They can directly upload images or PDFs of any supporting documents.
- Upon submission, the consumer receives an acknowledgement with a ticket number and an estimated timeline for the next update.

### Step 2: Vendor Notification and Evidence Submission

- Vendors are notified of the dispute via their preferred communication method and provided with access to the dispute details through a secure portal.
- Vendors upload evidence to support their case, including transaction records, communication logs with the consumer, and any terms of service that apply. They can also view the consumer's submitted documentation.
- A chat feature enables direct communication with the financial institutionâ€™s dispute management team for clarifications or negotiations.

### Step 3: AI-Assisted Preliminary Assessment and Mediation

- The fintech/bank employs AI algorithms to perform a preliminary assessment of the dispute validity by comparing the dispute details with the consumerâ€™s transaction history, vendorâ€™s evidence, and known patterns of fraudulent activities.
- The system categorizes the dispute for human review, highlighting key points and suggesting potential resolutions based on similar past disputes.
- A dedicated dispute manager reviews the compiled information, communicates with both parties if needed, and arrives at a decision. Throughout this process, both the consumer and the vendor receive status updates through their preferred channels.

### Step 4: Resolution and Feedback

- Upon resolution, both parties are informed of the outcome and the rationale behind the decision.
- The system automatically processes any required transaction reversals or adjustments.
- Both parties are invited to provide feedback on the dispute resolution process to help improve future handling.

## Integration and Sales Strategy

# PRD for PetSnuggle App

## Context

An app that allows you to hang out with and snuggle with locals' pets when you are traveling on business.

## tl;dr

The PetSnuggle App connects business travelers longing for pet companionship with locals willing to share their pets for companionship and snuggles.

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Create a community-driven platform that generates revenue through subscription and service fees.
- Provide a solution for loneliness and missing pet companionship for frequent travelers.
- Foster a new market of pet-friendly travel companionship services.

### User Goals

- Allow business travelers to experience pet companionship away from home.
- Provide pet owners with a reliable and rewarding way to share their pets with others.

### Non-Goals

- Becoming a pet adoption or pet-sitting service.
- Serving as a social network for pet enthusiasts.

## User Stories

- As a business traveler missing my pet, I want to find locals willing to let me hang out with their pet, so I can enjoy pet companionship while on the road.
- As a pet owner, I want to offer my pet's company to travelers, so I can help others while possibly earning extra income.

## User Experience - Step by Step Flow (Enhanced)

### Personalized Onboarding

Users are greeted with a warm, visually appealing interface. Through a series of engaging questions (a bit like a quiz), the app captures their preferencesâ€”type of pets, activities theyâ€™d enjoy (e.g., walking, playing, snuggling), and any pet allergies. This helps in tailoring the app experience from the get-go.

### Discovery and Inspiration

Similar to Airbnb's "Experiences," users can explore inspiring stories or "Featured Snuggles" highlighting unique and heartwarming past connections made through the app. This could include a photo diary of a traveler who spent an afternoon playing with a Siberian Husky in the snow or a quiet evening spent with a Siamese cat, watching the city lights from a high-rise apartment.

### Intuitive Matching Interface

Drawing from Tinderâ€™s swipe mechanism and Airbnbâ€™s filtering options, travelers can swiftly browse through potential pet matches with easy-to-use filters (location, pet type, ratings). Each pet profile offers a rich gallery, pet characteristics, and owner notes to help travelers make informed decisions.

### Interactive Planning Map

A dynamic map, similar to what Airbnb offers for accommodations, showcases available pets in the selected area. Pin drops reveal pets' photos and brief detailsâ€”clicking through provides the full profile and the option to initiate a hangout request.

### Seamless Communication and Scheduling

Once a match is approved, an in-app messaging system allows for easy communication to arrange the hangout details. A built-in calendar feature helps easily select and confirm available times, syncing with users' personal calendars if desired.

### Social Proof and Trust Building

Each pet and owner profile includes a verification badge (after passing certain criteria) and a section for reviews from previous hangouts. This, alongside a social feed within the app showcasing recent matches and testimonials, builds credibility and community.

### Post-Hangout Experience

After the hangout, users are prompted to share their story with photos or videos. A dual-rating system ensures feedback is given for both the pet and the owner, contributing to the communityâ€™s trustworthiness.

### Ongoing Engagement

Users receive personalized recommendations for future hangouts, based on previous likes and reviews. Seasonal or region-specific highlights populate the appâ€™s homepage, encouraging users to explore connections in different areas.

## Narrative

Imagine John, a business consultant who's away from home over 200 days a year. John misses his Labrador, Max, terribly during trips. Enter PetSnuggle: an app that connects John with local pet owners like Sarah, who believes her Golden Retriever, Buddy, can spread love and joy to more than just her family. Through PetSnuggle, John meets Buddy, and for a couple of hours, the loneliness of travel subsides. This is not just an app; it's a remedy for loneliness, a slice of home away from home.
