    "    A dedicated platform team accelerates AI value creation and capture for B2B SaaS companies\n",
    "\n",
    "Innovations are adopted quickly if they are easy to make, easy to use, fit existing patterns, and have visible results. Generative AI has abruptly changed the innovation landscape by acclerating the utility and availability of AI products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the vast majority of consumers and companies do not make technology, they are actively searching for value in this space. Consequently, technology companies are trying to implement AI features that create value for their customers as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The long tail of B2B SaaS companies have a unique set of challenges. They have enterprise client traction and skilled development teams but lack extra capital and in-house AI/ML resources, making it hard to bootstrap production grade AI capabilities and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dedicated platform team helps B2B SaaS companies stay competitive by quickly matching competitors advances and meeting client expectations for new experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This team drives innovation, positioning the company as a leader in AI, and reduces risk by providing systemic infrastructure and resources to prevent project failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It specifically helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Product teams launch AI features\n",
    "2. Business teams automate workflows\n",
    "3. Leaders unify AI strategy, standards and voice\n",
    "4. Clients adopt third-party AI products\n",
    "5. Staff upskill AI knowledge and skills\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, platform teams shape organisational culture, ensuring that responsibility and enthusiasm for AI are shared by everyone, not just a small group of evangelists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good platform teams function as skunkworks, rapid execution engines, and guardrails, ensuring the company quickly and safely integrates AI across all operations in order to benefit clients and establish AI leadership amongst competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "When bootstrapping platform teams, only speed and outcomes matter. Fast, cheap value creation determines whether platforms continue or are killed off because resources are limited, track records nonexistent and executive patience is thin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, platform teams must act for all functions and departments. Specifically, they should tackle cross disciplinary needs - at least product, design and engineering to start with - and champion fairness - equitable platform access to all products - as foundational principles for success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this environment, prioritisation is king and selecting the correct set of valuable and feasible initiatives to iterate on and build company confidence is crucial.\n",
