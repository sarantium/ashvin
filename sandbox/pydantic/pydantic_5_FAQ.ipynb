    "FAQ\n",
    "**Q:** Do AI platform teams lack the domain knowledge of specific products, making them unsuitable substitutes for product-specific engineering teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes, AI platform teams lack product-specific knowledge. They're support, not a substitute. To fix this, have the platform team act as a drop-in task force during critical phases, integrating AI while the product squad provides domain expertise. Alternatively, second selected product engineers from a squad to the platform team for a brief period - e.g. six weeks - to share domain knowledge and tailor AI solutions effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Will the product team be left to maintain the AI system alone after launch?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No. The platform team offers three months of hypercare for bugs and updates. Plus, the product team has access to observability tools to monitor performance and catch issues early. The platform team will also offer a BAU service request model for ongoing/complex issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Will relying on the platform team create bottlenecks and turn them into gatekeepers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No. The platform team is designed to be an enabler, not a gatekeeper. They prevent bottlenecks by embedding engineers with product teams during critical phases, offering self-service AI tools, and automated processes. The platform team also maintains clear communication and sets SLAs for quick response time. This ensures they support innovation and efficiency, rather than hindering progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Will product engineers miss out on learning AI if platform engineers handle the builds, and will knowledge leave with them?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No. Platform engineers work closely with product teams, provide hands-on training, and keep detailed documentation. Product engineers involved in builds will teach their squad, ensuring everyone learns and retains AI skills.\n",
    "**Q:** If I don't get approved to work with the platform team, does my AI journey end?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No. You can still use self-service tools, resources, and training from the platform team. Product teams keep decision-making autonomy and can build AI features on their own. Approved projects get embedded engineers and time-bound support, but this doesn't remove always-available features or limit reapplying for more support.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you promote equitable access to platform resources across departments and products?\n",
    "**A:** We set clear rules for resource allocation, ensure transparency, and provide self-service tools and training. Open communication helps manage competition, and all teams get equal access. Approved projects get extra support, but everyone can always use available features and reapply for more help.\n",
    "**Q:** How do we measure the platform team's success?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** We use practical metrics: time-to-market for AI features, the number of successful AI launches, user feedback, and AI feature funnel conversion from ideas to approved projects. This ensures our efforts provide real benefits to users and improve company results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do we measure the success of the AI features?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** The product team tracks user adoption, feedback, performance, and ROI. The platform team helps with tools for monitoring, synthetic data, and risk management. They also provide training, support, and regular reviews to ensure AI features deliver real value and meet business goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What happens if product teams don’t cooperate with the platform team, or vice versa?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** The platform team is an optional enabler, offering a range of services as needed. For approved projects with embedded engineers, cooperation is mandatory and ensured through formal agreements endorsed by managers and executives. These agreements include clear requirements, conditions, SLAs, and deliverables, ensuring alignment and accountability, which are critical for achieving company and user outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How does the platform team handle both innovation and BAU (Business As Usual) tasks simultaneously?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** The platform team manages both by dedicating 70% of their resources to innovation and 30% to BAU tasks. Given the newness of the platform team, this balance might shift as the environment and products mature, allowing for adjustments based on evolving needs and priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What if the platform team has too many critical projects to work on?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Managers and executives decide which projects to prioritize, based on the platform team's advice. We have a set ratio of resources to projects to manage capacity. This way, the most critical work gets done first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What if there's a critical issue post-launch that the product team or platform team can't handle?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** We build AI features with feature flags, allowing us to disable them if needed. The platform team maintains a risk and safety register and ensures quick rollback provisions at the code level. If a critical issue arises that the product team or platform team can't manage, we activate existing mechanisms for P1 incidents, including customer communications by senior engineers, managers, and support teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do we handle the risk of burnout and ensure sustainability if the platform team is constantly working in high-pressure sprints?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** The platform team operates in a high-pressure environment with a clear mission to accelerate AI feature launches. To manage burnout, we maintain a 70-30 split between innovation and BAU tasks, and rotate team members between high-intensity projects and less demanding tasks. We recruit team members with this demanding mission in mind from the outset, ensuring they are prepared for the challenges and committed to delivering high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What happens if there's a V2 feature idea after launch and hypercare?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** If a V2 feature idea arises post-launch and hypercare, it goes back through the standard stage gates. For already launched products, we have an accelerated stage gate process. Due to resource limits, product teams can also proceed independently or use a day expertise consultancy model outside of the six-week drop-in period for additional support.\n",
