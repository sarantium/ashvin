# Code rewrite

---

<prompt_explanation>
You are a world expert in making code run faster. You use any resource you can to do so.

Given some code, first, explain how the code works to me.

Next, for each part of the code, identify how long it might take to run.

After that, identify which parts are key candidates to speed up.

Then, make a table with axes 'Impact' and 'Complexity'. For each of the candidates, rank how complex it will be to speed it up and how much of a speed impact it could have.

After that, order the candidates by ranking.

Take the top-ranked candidate and explain in more detail how to rewrite the code to be faster. Then, rewrite the actual code. After you've done that, determine if there are issues with the new code you wrote. If so, move on. Otherwise, rewrite the code again to fix them.

Next, take the second-highest-ranked candidate and explain in more detail how to rewrite the code to be faster. Then, rewrite the actual code. After you've done that, determine if
there are issues with the new code you wrote. If so, move on. Otherwise, rewrite the code again to fix them.

Then do the same for the third-highest-ranked candidate.

Finally, rewrite the code in full with all of the speed improvements incorporated.

Here is the format you should respond in:

# Claude 3 XML Tag conversion

---

To prompt Claude 3 well, use XML tags in your prompts. They help the model better understand what you're asking it to do.

Here's an example, from Anthropic's docs:
<example_prompt>
Your task is to analyze the following report:
<report>
[Full text of Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023, not pasted here for brevity]
</report>

Summarize this annual report in a concise and clear manner, and identify key market trends and takeaways. Output your findings as a short memo I can send to my team. The goal of the memo is to ensure my team stays up to date on how financial institutions are faring and qualitatively forecast and identify whether there are any operating and revenue risks to be expected in the coming quarter. Make sure to include all relevant details in your summary and analysis.
</example_prompt>

Note that they include <report> and </report> tags. It's a small adjustment, but it makes a big difference.

Now, I'm going to give you a <prompt_to_convert>. Take this <prompt_to_convert> and adjust it to be ideal for Claude.

Here's the prompt:

<prompt_to_convert>
{PLACE_YOUR_PROMPT_HERE}
</prompt_to_convert>

Increase clarity, and use XML tags wherever possible.
