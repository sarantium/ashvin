The flywheel explained why Amazon and Facebook felt unstoppable, why Uber could burn billions and still look inevitable. We believed in it because it was happening right in front of us.</p> <p>But what we've learned is that every flywheel ends the same way. Growth slows and cheap money dries up, so platforms start squeezing. They raise fees and pack in more ads, putting pay-to-play ahead of merit while throttling APIs and organic reach. Service degrades as support shrinks, and new features tilt toward what monetizes rather than what actually helps users. There's a name for this: enshittification, the steady shift of value away from you and toward quarterly targets.</p> <p>You've seen it happen. Reddit hiked API prices so high that Apollo shut down and entire communities went dark in protest. Twitter killed free API access, breaking the third-party apps people actually liked using. Amazon set Prime Video to show ads by default unless you pay extra. Instagram tested opening straight into Reels, burying the feed people came for. Google's first page is now so packed with ads, AI summaries, and sponsored links that people type \"reddit\" at the end of queries just to find actual human answers. Each move trades your experience for their numbers.</p> <p>And it wasn't just users getting squeezed. Facebook killed local news ecosystems but never hired reporters. Uber destroyed taxi systems built over decades, replacing worker protections with surge pricing. Google trained its AI on everyone's content, then used it to bypass the creators entirely. They privatised the town square and left us with the bill: anxious teens, precarious workers, broken democracies. The flywheel's genius wasn't innovation; it was extraction. Move fast, break public goods, bank the value, leave society to clean up.</p> <p>This matters now because we're at a choice point. The flywheel's failure shows us what not to build. Don't mistake motion for strength, since it was always temporary, spinning growth as its own defence. At the precise moment platforms are degrading, artificial intelligence arrives. We can treat it as another extraction machine for the next earnings call, or we can build computational intelligence as civic infrastructure for the next century: something that holds under strain, expands human capability, and serves everyone.</p> <p>Our test is simple: sovereign AI must defend and it must expand. It must keep essential services running under load and leave people and institutions with greater capability when the pressure lifts. Infrastructure protects and empowers; platforms just extract. This is nation-building, not algorithms alone, but the workforce to shape them, the trust to implement them, the independent technology stack to run them, and the capital to sustain them. These are foundations, like roads and power and law, on which everything else can flourish.</p> <p>When you think about building foundations, the question isn't whether AI will reshape society. It's who decides what can be done and how choices get made. Every automated decision shifts power from humans you can challenge to systems you can't. Search results that once offered ten sources now give you one answer. Loan decisions once made by bankers you could appeal to now emerge from models that offer no recourse.</p> <p>Soon it won't just be decisions. Agents will act: trading, hiring, negotiating, building, with authority we grant but can't revoke transaction by transaction. They'll move faster than oversight, coordinate beyond human comprehension, and create facts on the ground before anyone can object.</p> <p>We're not building tools in any traditional sense. We're building decision infrastructure: the computational substrate through which collective intelligence emerges and coordinated action happens. When agents make millions of micro-decisions per second, when they negotiate and coordinate at scales humans can't track, they become the architecture of choice itself. Not tools we wield, but the medium through which economic and social decisions flow.</p> <p>In industrial economies, sovereignty meant controlling physical infrastructure: ports, rail, energy grids. In post-industrial economies, it meant controlling information flows. Now we're entering something different: an era where intelligence itself is infrastructure. Where the capacity to decide, to act, to coordinate at machine speed becomes the foundation everything else runs on.</p> <p>Look at societies that actually last. They're not built on compounding loops. They're built on the strength of their fabric. Singapore calls this Total Defence: five layers working together to secure the nation. The Nordics talk about Strong Societies, where trust and cohesion matter more than any fortress. The lesson is clear: sovereignty isn't one moat or one product. It's the strength of people, institutions, and infrastructure working together.</p> <p>We need to treat AI at this level. Not as a quarterly growth engine, but as civic infrastructure that has to be guarded and renewed. Like any critical infrastructure, it needs redundancy, maintenance, workforce development, and governance structures that outlast political cycles. That means four things:</p>","tags":["ai","sovereignty","infrastructure","governance"]},{"location":"blog/2025/10/20/beyond-the-flywheel---ai-as-infrastructure/#the-four-pillars","title":"The Four Pillars","text":"","tags":["ai","sovereignty","infrastructure","governance"]},{"location":"blog/2025/10/20/beyond-the-flywheel---ai-as-infrastructure/#workforce","title":"Workforce","text":"<p>Let's be direct: AI will replace jobs. The responsibility of government and society isn't to soften that truth with easy words. It's to act with urgency.</p> <p>We need large-scale reskilling programs that actually work. Safety nets designed for the shock that's coming. Clear pathways for people whose work will be displaced. Not vague promises, but concrete transitions with real support.</p> <p>Without this planning, disruption won't resolve itself into new opportunity. It will fracture the social fabric and weaken the state. This isn't a problem that solves itself. Either we build the infrastructure for transition now, or we deal with the consequences later when it's much harder and much more expensive.</p>","tags":["ai","sovereignty","infrastructure","governance"]},{"location":"blog/2025/10/20/beyond-the-flywheel---ai-as-infrastructure/#trust","title":"Trust","text":"<p>Responsible AI without enforcement is just performance. If citizens live under systems they cannot challenge, appeal, or scrutinize, legitimacy collapses.</p> <p>Trust requires audits with real teeth. It requires rights of redress that actually function, not complaint forms that go nowhere. It means confronting failures in public rather than hiding them behind PR statements.</p> <p>And the harder part: regulation must be shielded from capture. When the people writing the rules are planning their next job at the companies being regulated, the whole system becomes theatre. We need regulators with genuine independence, real technical capacity, and the authority to act when things go wrong. Anything less is just paperwork.</p>","tags":["ai","sovereignty","infrastructure","governance"]},{"location":"blog/2025/10/20/beyond-the-flywheel---ai-as-infrastructure/#technology","title":"Technology","text":"<p>A nation that depends entirely on external platforms might imagine it's buying efficiency. In truth, it's mortgaging sovereignty.</p> <p>To rent your stack is to rent your future. If you cannot walk away from a vendor in thirty days, you're not a customer. You're a colony. Every dependency that cannot be broken isn't infrastructure. It's submission dressed up as convenience.</p> <p>This doesn't mean building everything from scratch or rejecting all foreign technology. It means ensuring you can switch. That you understand how critical systems work. That you have alternatives when you need them. Sovereignty is about optionality: having the technical capacity and workforce to maintain, modify, and replace systems that matter.</p> <p>The test is simple: can you leave? If not, you don't own your infrastructure. You're renting it, and rent always goes up.</p>","tags":["ai","sovereignty","infrastructure","governance"]},{"location":"blog/2025/10/20/beyond-the-flywheel---ai-as-infrastructure/#economy","title":"Economy","text":"<p>It's pleasant to say AI will grow the economy. The harder truth is that AI will run the economy at machine speed.</p> <p>Agents will approve loans, set prices, negotiate contracts, allocate credit, moving faster than human oversight can match. In this world, decision-power itself becomes money. Control over these systems is economic power.</p> <p>If those decisions are made by systems controlled elsewhere, you haven't just outsourced technology. You've outsourced command of your economy itself.</p> <p>Think about what that means. When an algorithm somewhere else decides who gets capital, at what price, and on what terms, that's not a technology question anymore. It's a sovereignty question. When foreign systems decide which businesses can access credit, which sectors get investment, which regions get development, you're no longer running your own economy. You're asking permission to participate in it.</p> <p>This is why the technology pillar and the economy pillar are inseparable. Economic sovereignty requires technological independence. You cannot have one without the other.</p> <p>These four pillars (workforce, trust, technology, economy) aren't separate problems. They're facets of the same challenge: building AI infrastructure that serves the public rather than extracting from it. Infrastructure that defends essential capabilities and expands what people and institutions can do.</p> <p>The flywheel era taught us what happens when we optimize for growth above all else. Now we have a chance to build something different.</p> <p>What's possible: Systems that coordinate millions of micro-decisions at machine speed while keeping humans in command of what matters. Teachers who actually know when a student is struggling because the system handles the compliance paperwork they used to drown in. Justice infrastructure that learns what reduces reoffending across decades of cases, while judges and caseworkors keep discretion over individual lives. Local councils that can fix potholes and approve permits faster than committees can meet, but citizens still control the budget. Employment services that match people to real careers, not just tick placement boxes for government contracts. Not platforms extracting value from every interaction, but infrastructure that amplifies human judgment at the speed and scale modern society requires.</p> <p>The easier path is to rent everything, chase the quarterly number, and let platforms extract value until they degrade. That path is well-worn. We know exactly where it leads.</p> <p>The harder path means building when it's easier to buy, thinking in decades when quarters are what get measured. It means treating AI as infrastructure we maintain rather than software we subscribe to. The thing about infrastructure: when it works, it disappears. Roads don't get credit for the economy they enable. Power grids don't get celebrated for the lives they improve. They just work, year after year, holding up everything else.</p> <p>That's the choice. Not AI that dazzles for a quarter then degrades, but infrastructure so reliable it becomes invisible, so foundational it expands what's possible for everyone who uses it.</p> <p>The platforms taught us that extraction is temporary. Sooner or later, you run out of things to squeeze. But infrastructure compounds differently. Every year it stands, it enables more. Every crisis it survives, it proves its worth. The work of building it is hard and the returns are slow, but what gets built becomes the ground everything else stands on. That's not a quarterly story. That's how societies last.</p>","tags":["ai","sovereignty","infrastructure","governance"]},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""}]}
